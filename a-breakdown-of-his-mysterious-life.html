This was a common complaint from <a href=#>Howard Stern</a>, who often attempted to delve deeper into the fitness guru's personal life while interviewing him on his radio show. Often this line of <a href=#>questioning would cause Simmons to dash out of Stern's studio</a>. A similar thing would happen whenever anyone else tried to expose Simmons' personal life, including the question of his sexuality.</p><p>Following<a href=#> his 2014 disappearance from Hollywood</a>, fans of Richard Simmons were even more curious about what was happening to him. Then the March 2024 revelation that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is suffering from skin cancer,</a> opened up the issue even further. This article will reveal<strong> what we know about Simmons's life in hiding</strong> as well as what he's shared about his skin cancer diagnosis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-richard-simmons-was-seen-and-what-has-he-been-doing>When Was The Last Time Richard Simmons Was Seen And What Has He Been Doing?</h2><p><strong>Richard Simmons vanished from the public eye in 2014</strong> following a multi-decade career as a fitness guru, frequent talk show guest, and entertainer. The man was and is absolutely beloved, and this made the end of his career even more heartbreaking. While Simmons has always been private, his decision to omit details surrounding his decision<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> caused numerous controversies and conspiracy theories to arise</a>. Perhaps none more prevalent than the <strong>rumor he was <a href=#>being held against his will by his housekeeper</a></strong>, Teresa Reveles. This is something Simmons himself came out of hiding to dispute.</p><p>According to The Today Show, Simmons said the following:</p><p>"No one is holding me in my house as a hostage. You know, I do what I want to do as I've always done so people should sort of just believe what I have to say."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/richard-simmons-shocked-fans-by-coming-out-of-hiding-and-taking-selfies-outside-of-his-home-front-back-deposit.jpg><p>Then there was the claim that Simmons was secretly dying and therefore wanted to do so in private. This is something he also has disputed, according to Today. So, what did happen and what has Simmons been up to?</p><p>Following widespread fame thanks to his "Sweatin to the Oldies" workout videos, appearances on shows like Whose Line Is It Anyway, The Larry Sanders Show, and Saturday Night Live, as well as various talk show appearances, Richard Simmons vanished from the spotlight. He did so over the course of many years, according to Salon. A report from eOnline claimed that <strong>Simmons's representatives were quietly turning down offers</strong> on Simmons's request. But it wasn't until February 2014 that he disappeared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/richard-simmons-5.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Richard Simmons Shocked Fans By Coming Out Of Hiding And Taking Selfies Outside of His Home">Richard Simmons Shocked Fans By Coming Out Of Hiding And Taking Selfies Outside of His Home</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Richard Simmons has been an enigma for years but he once came out of his home to take photos with random fans.</p><p>By 2016, <strong>Simmons' friends were publicly claiming they hadn't heard from him in two years</strong>. This caused numerous conspiracies to start including one from Simmons' assistant, Mauro Oliveira. According to Salon, <strong>Oliveria claimed that his boss was being "controlled"</strong> by his brother, manager, and housekeeper, Teresa Reveles.</p><p>According to CNN, Mauro Oliveria said the following:</p><p>“I feel that Richard is now being controlled by the very people that he controlled his whole life. Controlled in the sense that they are taking advantage of his weak mental state. Controlled in the sense that they are controlling his mail, controlling his everything."</p><p>Oliveria's comments prompted Simmons to take to his Facebook and say, “I can’t believe I was trending on Facebook! After some questions about my health and whereabouts, I’ll be calling in to 'Today Show' tomorrow morning.

He also delved into the <strong>conspiracy theory that Simmons was going through a sex change</strong>. This rumor even made Simmons's former friend Howard Stern curious as it was endlessly discussed on his SiriusXM radio show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/richard-simmons-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of the hubbub <strong>caused the LAPD to do a welfare check on Simmons</strong>.

According to the series, Simmons decided to live a private life after having serious issues with his knee. This caused him to <strong>need a double knee surgery</strong>. The result of this was his having difficulties walking and exercising, the lifeblood of his career. None of these reports could be verified as Simmons neither confirmed nor denied them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2023, a representative of Simmons reached out to Entertainment Tonight and claimed that he was happy to be celebrating his 75th birthday. But other than this, no news of his life in hiding reached the public. This led to a death hoax in 2024 as well as a supposed biopic put into development with Pauly Shore playing Simmons. Not only did Simmons come out to refute involvement in this biopic but he posted a rather grime comment to his Facebook:</p><p>"I have some news to tell you. Please don’t be sad. I am . . . dying. Oh, I can see your faces now. The truth is we all are dying. Every day we live we are getting closer to our death."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simmons' spokesperson later clarified Simmons' comment in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter saying that he was "not dying". The fitness guru also confirmed that he wasn't dying by taking to Twitter/X.</p><p>"Sorry many of you have gotten upset about my message today. Even the press has gotten in touch with me. I am not dying. It was a message about saying how we should embrace every day that we have. Sorry for this confusion. Love, Richard.”</p><p>But soon after, Simmons had a very real and serious health update for his fans. He was <strong>diagnosed with skin cancer.</strong></p><h2 id=what-kind-of-skin-cancer-does-richard-simmons-have>What Kind Of Skin Cancer Does Richard Simmons Have?</h2><p>On March 19th, 2024, Richard Simmons took to his Facebook to reveal that he had been <strong>diagnosed with Basal Cell Carcinoma.</strong> Simmons was told he had skin cancer after he found a "strange-looking bump under" his right eye.</p><p>Basal Cell Carcinoma is a typical, non-life-threatening skin cancer that can be cured via surgery, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Simmons had to see a specialist a total of three times to get the skin cancer removed completely.</p><p>"Well the third time was a charm."</p><p>Simmons then urged his fans to get themselves checked by a specialist immediately after noticing something out of the ordinary on their body.</p><p>After this, Simmons, once again, vanished from the spotlight.
