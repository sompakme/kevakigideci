But not every role in Hollywood calls for a person that&nbsp;is aesthetically pleasing. And while the actors that get cast in these roles may be gorgeous in real life, you would never know it if you only looked at them in these roles. But thankfully, that's where we come in. As we go through 15 of the more physically repulsive characters that Hollywood has asked for a role, but also show what these actors typically look like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of these actors would spend hours every day making sure their appearance was ugly enough for the cameras. A job that becomes a lot harder when someone like Thesy Surface, who plays the repulsive Margaret McPoyle in&nbsp;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, is stunning. Or&nbsp;Daveigh Chase who scared you senseless in&nbsp;The Ring, but her good looks may mean that the idea of asking her on a date may be an even more intimidating task to conquer.</p><p>Several actors have also shown their dedication to a role by making that transformation not only in the makeup chair&nbsp;but in the grocery store. Charlize Theron recently packed on some serious poundage for her recent role thanks to her new good friend, potato chips. Perhaps she took inspiration from actors like Jonah Hill who ballooned up for&nbsp;War Dogs. And while you may love looking at Margot Robbie, you probably wouldn't guess it's her when you see her in one of the most exciting upcoming movies&nbsp;Queen of Scots&nbsp;that also stars Saoirse Ronan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are the 15 best examples when attractive celebrities were asked to play characters that were far from it!</p><h2 id=delphine-chan-ac---splice><strong>Delphine Chanéac - Splice</strong></h2><p>Delphine Chanéac knew that her face wasn't exactly going to get recognized after her appearance in the science-fiction film, Splice.</p><p>The film saw her play the role of Dren. The film&nbsp;also had Adrien Brody step into the lead role and it scored 74% on Rotten Tomatoes. So if you're looking for an entertaining and well-made science-fiction film, we may have found what you're watching next.</p><p>When discussing the role with Popcorn Biz, it was revealed by the director Vincenzo Natali that the original intention was to give Dren hair. But after the process proved to be too expensive, Chanéac stepped up and offered to shave off her own hair. Though there was one condition.</p><p><strong>"My only demand was that I do it myself. I went to this hairdresser on the mall in Toronto where we were shooting, grabbed the little machine and cut it across my head for fun."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a look that Chanéac also seemed to embrace in her day-to-day life away from the set,&nbsp;"They bought me a wig, but I didn't want to wear it. I was bald."&nbsp;Though you may think she looks even more beautiful with a full head of hair in the photo we've selected on the right.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBCChicago</a>)</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey---gold-196><strong>Matthew McConaughey - Gold (196)</strong></h2><p>Sadly for Matthew McConaughey, Gold was one of the more disappointing films of his career. The film failed to make back its budget, earning $11.5 million versus the $20 million budget, and also scored a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 42%.</p><p>But McConaughey can definitely say that he had a lot of fun transforming his body for the role. When McConaughey talked about how he attained the 47-pound weight gain that he amassed over 6 months he stated, he said,</p><p><strong>"No exercise, I wouldn't even take the floors to the 2nd floor, that would be too much exercise. I was eating cheeseburgers all the time..trying out all these fast-food restaurants I've only had one time...Cheeseburgers and beers would do the trick,"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also mentioned,&nbsp;"You could say yes to whatever you wanted to eat, whatever you wanted to drink. Whenever that was fun.
