The banishment came as a result of racial comments Sterling made that were caught on tape. He is not the first owner of a professional sports team to have this happen to them. In 1996, Cincinnati Reds’ owner Marge Schott also received a lifetime ban from the sport. She was banned after making racist statements towards Jews, Blacks, and Asians while giving support for Nazism and the actions of Adolf Hitler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Getting banned forever from a sport is not a new occurrence. There were many players banned from major league baseball in the late 1800s for a multitude of different reasons. Today, it is not so common. When it happens it tends to be big news. Normally, the person in question had a number of chances to change their behavior and appeal their sentence before finally being thrown out for good.</p><p>This list shows some of the biggest name players to ever been suspended from a sport for life. They are ranked in order of their popularity. Some of the players are very well known, while others are less popular. Each one of them had their career cut short for one reason or another. Most of them were given a second chance and still were unable to change their ways. Regardless of whether they claim innocence or finally managed to turn their lives around, these players will always be banned for life from their respective sports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-stanley-wilson----nfl><b>10. Stanley Wilson -- NFL</b></h2><p>Via latimes.com</p><p>Stanley Wilson was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals ninth overall in the 1983 draft. Throughout his career, he had a major problem with cocaine. His drug problem caused him to be suspended for both the 1985 and 1987 seasons. In 1988, on the night before Super Bowl XXIII he was found in the Bengals’ locker room high on cocaine by the team’s position coach, Jim Anderson. Since this was his third violation of the league’s drug policy, Wilson received a lifetime ban from the NFL. He was in and out of rehab following his banishment. In 1999, Wilson was found guilty of stealing $130,000 and sentenced to 22 years in prison.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-art-schlichter----nfl><b>9. Art Schlichter -- NFL</b></h2><p><b></b></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Art Schlichter played quarterback for the Baltimore and Indianapolis Colts from 1982 to 1986. At this time, the NFL had rules prohibiting its players to participate in gambling of any kind whether legal or illegal. Schlichter took his $20,000 signing bonus and began betting on basketball games. By 1983, he was in debt to bookies to the tune of $700,000. Fearing for his life, he went to the government to protect him. The NFL gave him an indefinite suspension for the acts. He was reinstated after one season, but then cut by the Colts in 1985 when they heard rumors he was out gambling again. He was picked up in the offseason by the Buffalo Bills, but was cut shortly after because the team reached a deal with <a title="Jim Kelly Net Worth" href=#>Jim Kelly</a>. The deal made Kelly the highest-paid quarterback in the league’s history at that time.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-roy-tarpley----nba><b>8. Roy Tarpley -- NBA</b></h2><p>Via mavswiki.com</p><p>Roy Tarpley was a center and power forward for the Dallas Mavericks. He played for the team for four years from 1986 to 1990. He was permanently banned from the NBA in 1994 following a third failed drug test. Tarpley appealed and was going to be reinstated for the 1995 season. Unfortunately, Tarpley could not make it that far. He was officially banned for life in 1995 for drinking alcohol which violated the terms of a court imposed personal aftercare program. Tarley holds the career record for most rebounds per game, but he is still more renowned for his banishment from the NBA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-billy-coutu----nhl><b>7.

He was banned from the sport in 1927 after he started a bench clearing brawl in the fourth game of the Stanley Cup Finals. He started the fight by attacking referees Jerry Laflamme and Billy Bell. Coutu claimed he was instructed to attack them by his coach, Art Ross. In 1929, the NHL lightened his ban by allowing him to play minor league hockey, but he would never be allowed to play at the professional level again.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-dexter-manley----nfl><b>6.

During his playing career, Rose won three World Series rings with the Cincinnati Reds and his 4,256 career hits are still an all-time record. In 1989, while he was managing the Reds, Rose was accused of placing bets against his team. He was consequentially banished from the sport. In 1991, the Baseball Hall of Fame announced that Rose would be ineligible for induction. Following many years of denying these accusations, in 2004 Rose admitted to placing sports bets while he was a member of the Reds, but continued to deny that he ever bet against the Reds. To this day, he is still banned from admittance into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5BpZJqsmKGytbHSZq6hp12ssrOxjJuYp6aVmXqnvs6mZK2glZ6%2Fbr%2FPqKmtZZakv264yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f10-athletes-who-were-banned-from-their-sport-for-life.html&title=10%20Athletes%20Who%20Were%20Banned%20From%20Their%20Sport%20For%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-athletes-who-were-banned-from-their-sport-for-life.html&description=10%20Athletes%20Who%20Were%20Banned%20From%20Their%20Sport%20For%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-athletes-who-were-banned-from-their-sport-for-life.html&title=10%20Athletes%20Who%20Were%20Banned%20From%20Their%20Sport%20For%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f10-athletes-who-were-banned-from-their-sport-for-life.html&title=10%20Athletes%20Who%20Were%20Banned%20From%20Their%20Sport%20For%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f10-athletes-who-were-banned-from-their-sport-for-life.html&text=10%20Athletes%20Who%20Were%20Banned%20From%20Their%20Sport%20For%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f10-athletes-who-were-banned-from-their-sport-for-life.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Reinaldo Massengill</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-03</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./bachelorette-rachel-recchia-slams-tino-franco-s-bip-shade.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Bachelorette Rachel Recchia Slams Tino Francos BiP Shade</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./who-is-dak-prescott-dating-meet-cowboys-qb-s-love-sarah-jane-ramos.html><h3>Who Is Dak Prescott Dating?
