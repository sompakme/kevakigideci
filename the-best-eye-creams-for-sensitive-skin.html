Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>The skin around the eyes is delicate, and can be a problematic area for those with sensitive skin. Finding a top-quality eye cream that targets your concerns without causing irritation can be challenging if you have sensitive skin. Thankfully, there are plenty of great options on the market that are crafted to give the skin the support it needs without triggering inflammation. After analyzing the various options on the market, we’ve created the ultimate guide to the best eye creams for sensitive skin.</p><h2><strong>What to Look For in an Eye Cream – and What to Avoid</strong></h2><p>Let’s first talk about the eye-cream ingredients you should avoid if you have sensitive skin. We recommend skipping formulas containing fragrances (especially synthetic ones) or alcohol. Alcohol will cause dryness in sensitive skin (which often is already prone to being dry), while fragrances can cause irritation in both the skin and the eyes.</p><p>Those with sensitive skin should practice caution with products containing retinol. Many anti-aging eye creams on the market are made with this vitamin A derivative, as it is one of the most effective ingredients for softening fine lines and wrinkles and enhancing firmness and elasticity. However, it also has a high risk of causing irritation and dryness, which can be especially problematic for easily aggravated complexions.</p><p>If you’re desperate to try a retinol eye cream, we recommend choosing a low-concentration formula that also contains soothing and moisturizing ingredients to help counteract negative side effects. Alternatively, you can try a bakuchiol eye cream. Bakuchiol is a plant-derived ingredient that is considered to be a gentler alternative to retinol.</p><p>If you are looking to address signs of aging, there are other ingredients that are typically better tolerated by sensitive skin. In addition to bakuchiol, we recommend looking for formulas with vitamin C or peptides. These ingredients can help promote more youthful eyes.</p><p>We also suggest reaching for antioxidant-rich formulas. Antioxidants protect the skin from the harmful effects of free radicals, which can cause skin damage and premature signs of aging. Antioxidant-packed ingredients include vitamin E and green tea extract.</p><p>Anyone prone to dark circles can benefit from eye creams infused with ingredients like caffeine and ginseng, which can help brighten and depuff for more energized eyes. Additionally, we recommend reaching for formulas with hydrating ingredients to plump and soften the skin around the eye area. Ceramides, hyaluronic acid, sodium hyaluronate, shea butter, squalane and glycerin are all excellent options.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, we suggest looking for clean formulas. We particularly recommend formulas made without ingredients like parabens and phthalates, as those chemicals have the potential to irritate the skin.</p><h2><strong>The Best Eye Creams for Sensitive Skin</strong></h2><p>Ready to take your skincare routine to the next level? Here’s the ultimate list of the best eye creams for sensitive skin. No matter your specific concerns or budget, you’ll find at least one option that works perfectly for your needs.</p><h3><strong>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Eye Stick</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image1-28.png alt="Blu Atlas Eye Stick" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The Blu Atlas Eye Stick is packed with nutrient-dense, high-quality ingredients that target signs of aging, dark circles and puffiness. These ingredients (96% of which are naturally derived) are able to deliver visible results without aggravating sensitive skin. The formula is vegan and cruelty-free, and doesn’t contain fragrances, parabens or phthalates, so you can feel safe using it in your routine.</p><p>This formula is crafted with <i>Coffea canephora</i> seed extract (which is packed with caffeine) and niacinamide, which work together to brighten dark circles for a more energized appearance. These ingredients are joined by ascorbic acid, a potent form of vitamin C that further works to lighten dark circles while stimulating collagen production to reduce visible signs of aging. It also provides antioxidant benefits, ensuring the eye area is optimally protected against the damaging effects of free radicals.</p><p>Palmitoyl tripeptide-5 (an effective peptide) helps soften fine lines and wrinkles while firming the skin, promoting a younger-looking eye area. Soothing rose flower water also reduces puffiness. Additionally, nutrient-rich algae extract strengthens the skin, while squalane, sodium hyaluronate and panthenol plump the eye area with moisture, promoting a softer feel and smoother look. This premium eye cream comes in a rollerball, which makes application a breeze.</p><h3><strong>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Alpyn Beauty Line-Filling Eye Cream With Bakuchiol and Caffeine</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3-30.png alt="Alpyn Beauty Line-Filling Eye Cream With Bakuchiol and Caffeine" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>One of our favorite anti-aging eye creams for sensitive skin is the Line-Filling Eye Cream from Aplyn Beauty. As well as tackling signs of aging, the formula works to reduce puffiness and boost radiance around the eyes, promoting a youthful and awakened appearance. The brand has evidence to back up these lofty claims: 100% of participants in an independent clinical trial agreed that this eye cream improved texture and smoothness after 14 days of use, and 92% agreed that there was an improvement in the appearance of fine lines and puffiness.</p><p>This creamy formula is powered by bakuchiol, which works to smooth fine lines and wrinkles and enhance elasticity and firmness without causing the irritation and dryness many experience with retinol. Vitamin C (in the form of ascorbic acid) provides additional anti-aging benefits. It also brightens dark circles and adds protective antioxidant benefits.</p><p>Another key ingredient in this formula is caffeine, which helps alleviate puffiness and dark circles. Additionally, algae works to nourish the skin as it boosts firmness, while sodium hyaluronate, glycerin and squalane boost moisture levels.</p><p>Like other Alpyn Beauty products, this eye cream is infused with ingredients derived from sustainably harvested plants around Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The clean formula is vegan, cruelty-free and made without parabens, phthalates, fragrances or dyes.</p><h3><strong>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">First Aid Beauty Hydrating Eye Cream With Hyaluronic Acid</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image2.png alt="First Aid Beauty Hydrating Eye Cream With Hyaluronic Acid" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>If your sensitive skin is in need of some serious hydration, we recommend this eye cream from First Aid Beauty, which is made to be safe for sensitive skin. It’s packed with some of the most effective ingredients for sealing moisture into the skin, and has been clinically proven to provide 24 hours of hydration. At the same time, it helps reduce puffiness, smooth lines and lighten dark circles.</p><p>The Hydrating Eye Cream is powered by hyaluronic acid, which draws moisture to the skin and locks it in for long-term hydration.

Some may prefer only to use their eye cream at night, especially if they’ve chosen a thick formula. With consistent daily usage, you’ll be able to get the best results from your eye cream.</p><p>The one big caveat here is to do with retinol eye creams. These should only be used in the evening, since retinol can increase the skin’s sensitivity to UV rays and degrades when exposed to the sun. For those with sensitive skin, nightly usage may be too aggressive, even when using a formula with a lower concentration of retinol. It’s best to start with application every other night to see how it works with your skin. Bakuchiol-powered formulas can typically be used daily, but pay attention to how your skin reacts to your product of choice, and adjust accordingly.</p><h3><strong>Should you use an eye cream in the morning or at night?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned above, most eye creams can be used both morning and night, except for retinol eye creams. If you wear makeup, you might find that heavier eye cream is best used as part of your nighttime routine, as the formula may cause mascara, concealer and other cosmetics to smudge. If you’d still like to use an eye product during the day, go for a lightweight cream, gel or serum-based eye cream.</p><h3><strong>What is the best way to apply eye cream?</strong></h3><p>Take a small amount of the product on your ring finger, and then gently tap it underneath the eyes and up to the brow bone. The ring finger gives you the gentlest application, which is essential since the skin underneath the eyes is extra delicate. If you’re using an eye cream that comes with an applicator (like a rollerball), you can use that to apply the product. Just ensure you aren’t putting too much pressure on the eye area.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the best results, be sure to apply an eye cream at the right point in your routine. We recommend applying your eye cream after cleansing, serums, and moisturizer. At night, this means it will be the very last product in your routine (although, if you also use a facial oil, you’ll want to apply your eye cream first). In the morning, you should apply your eye cream before you put on sunscreen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2axqZ5wqucmqVdqLKvv8itoK%2BdXai4qrqO</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fthe-best-eye-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html&title=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-eye-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html&description=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-eye-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html&title=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fthe-best-eye-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html&title=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fthe-best-eye-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html&text=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fthe-best-eye-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-21</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./this-bobby-berk-approved-knife-sharpening-set-is-20-off-now.html><h3>&lt;&lt; This Bobby Berk-Approved Knife Sharpening Set Is 20% Off Now</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./sandra-denton-aka-pepa-net-worth.html><h3>Sandra Denton AKA Pepa Net Worth >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
