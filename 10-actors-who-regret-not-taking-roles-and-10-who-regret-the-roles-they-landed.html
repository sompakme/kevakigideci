There is so much behind the scenes that we never get to know or even understand, that people mostly get the wrong idea about Hollywood and the movie industry as a whole a lot of the time. First, have you ever stopped to think about how many of the great movies you have watched could have been different in a fundamental level? Just imagine if instead of having Reese Witherspoon portraying Elle Woods in Legally Blonde, we had someone like Christina Applegate playing the role. Yeah, that would change the movie at a fundamental level. And yes, for those of you already asking yourselves, that is one of the entries we will have on this list. Actors and actresses don’t become known throughout the world just because of the roles they play, but also because of the ones they let slip away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A regular movie fan would be surprised at the number of iconic roles that went to actors or actresses who were not even the third or fourth option the director and production staff had for the part. So, without any further delay, let’s show you 10 actors who regret not taking roles and 10 who regret the roles they landed.</p><h2 id=took-sean-connery>Took: Sean Connery</h2><p>James Bond is one of the biggest characters of all time. It is almost impossible for you to go around the streets of any country and ask if a random person knows Agent 007 and get a negative answer. Everyone knows who James Bond was, and most people know all of the actors who have portrayed the legendary secret agent on the big screen.</p><p><strong>One of the men who received most acclamation for the role was Sean Connery, who started playing James Bond in the 60s.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What many people might not have realized is that despite the fact that he was the first James Bond, Sean Connery might also be the one person in the world who most hates James Bond. Apparently, he got tired of the role so quickly that he began giving his salary to charity and said he would&nbsp;end James Bond if he had a chance. (Source: FirstPost)</p><h2 id=didn-t-take-michelle-pfeiffer-and-jodie-foster>Didn’t Take: Michelle Pfeiffer And Jodie Foster</h2><p>Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster are two of the most decorated actresses of all time. To put it all into awards, Michelle was nominated for three different Academy Awards and even won a Golden Globe for best actress. Jodie has even more accolades, as she was the recipient of two Academy Awards as well as three Golden Globes. Yeah, these two are ladies who have already done everything there is to do in the movie industry. However, even in their illustrious careers, there was one movie that both of them probably regret not being a part of. That movie was Thelma and Louise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Michelle and Jodie were cast during the preproduction of the movie, but the process took so long that they had to decline the roles because they had to work on other projects.&nbsp; (Source: Today)</p><h2 id=took-bill-murray>Took: Bill Murray</h2><p>Bill Murray is one of those actors who doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone. Come on, the guy was one of the leads in Ghostbusters, you can’t really beat that. But more than iconic roles that became classics, Murray has always been one of those guys who, whenever someone saw his name in a movie poster, it would be like a synonym to a good motion picture. That might be why playing Garfield became one of the biggest regrets of Murray’s career.</p><p><strong>At first, it sounded like a joke, but it is not tough to see why Murray was not satisfied with the end-result of Garfield.</strong></p><p>The problem was that the script was terrible, and apparently, the director decided to film all of the live-action scenes before Murray got a chance to be Garfield, which meant he could change nothing with improvisation.

This happens when fame goes up to someone’s head. However, the problem here is when that fame is not yet enough to keep you relevant in the Hollywood landscape. One person who portrays that truth very well is Christina Applegate. In 2001, she was one of the best up-and-coming actresses in the business after her success in the TV series Married... with Children.</p><p><strong>Because of that, she was reluctant to take a similar role to the one she had, which would have been the case if she had agreed to play Elle Woods in Legally Blonde.</strong></p><p>Yes, ladies, your favorite lawyer was never supposed to be Reese Witherspoon, it was supposed to be Christina Applegate. Unfortunately for Christina, she turned down a role that could have made her skyrocket in Hollywood.

However, it seems like he had this very real concern before the Bourne Ultimatum went to theaters.</p><p><strong>Apparently, Damon thought the script was so terrible that not even all of the action scenes would be able to save the third film in the Bourne franchise.</strong></p><p>And despite how openly he voiced his concerns, Universal Pictures disregarded everything he had to say and continued production. Since he was under contract, there was little Matt could do but complete the project and try to save what he thought was already a goner. Surprisingly, the movie did pretty well and pulled in around $442 million at the box office.

The thing is that Hanks was not supposed to play this particular iconic character. Not at all, Tom was actually not even the third choice for this part. The guy who got the first call was supposedly John Travolta, who unwittingly decided to turn down the part that would go one to earn Tom Hanks his second Oscar.</p><p>Now, this is one that must sting because no matter how famous Travolta is, the one thing he has yet to win in the movie industry is an Academy Award. Yeah, the guy was nominated two times for the award of best actor, first in 1978 for his role in Saturday Night Fever, and then in 1995 for the classic Pulp Fiction,&nbsp;but couldn't land a win.

A surprising one we found out about was that Kate Winslet absolutely despised her acting in Titanic. Yeah, right? This was arguably one of the greatest movies of all time, and the leading actress hated her own acting?

At the same time, when someone has become so recognized for juggernaut roles like Han Solo and Indiana Jones, it becomes tough for the audience to think of that actor as anything other than one of those characters. This was the main reason why Harrison Ford declined Steven Spielberg’s invite to play the main character in the 1993 Schindler’s List.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ford thought that it would be a bad deal for the movie and the story behind it to have his face connected to the main character as it would probably take away from the figure of Oskar Schindler. This might have been a good decision for the movie as a whole, but no one can deny that Harrison must feel a bit of disappointment for not being a part of such a massive project.

After all, while Damon thought his career would be over because of one film, Affleck almost had that happen for real.</p><p>When people think Daredevil these days they imagine the Netflix series, which is amazing. And someone who is probably very happy with that is Ben Affleck. For those of you who don’t remember, Affleck played the visually impaired lawyer/superhero in a 2003 movie adaptation. A movie adaptation that was so bad Affleck openly said he hated the movie and it also cost him a long time to bounce back within the industry.

Those people would not be too far off if you are someone who agrees that Katie’s marriage to Tom Cruise was not the greatest of times in her life.</p><p>Talking about her professional life, there are two roles she could have taken that would have put her in the new standard of celebrity life and professional recognition.

Stephanie Meyer apparently wanted Emily Browning to play Bella Swan.

Sure, Robert was probably glad at first that the movie provided him a chance to have a relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart away from the cameras, but when it comes to the movie itself, he was very open as to how much he hated all of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Be it because he was playing a guy who seemed too perfect to be real, he decided the right way to portray Edward was as a “manic-depressed who hates himself.”</strong></p><p>Oh yeah, it also seems he despised the attention he got from all the Twilight fangirls and even said that their screams are probably what people hear at the gates of hell.

Don’t get us wrong, those were all superb acting parts that he played very well, but none of them was as career changing as becoming Batman would have been for this guy.
