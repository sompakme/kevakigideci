Believe it or not, our perception of how life works and what people are really like is largely influenced by film and television. That means, the way we see ourselves is, in a roundabout way, governed by what celebrities are like. It's a weird thought, but it's true. But we're talking about the characters they play. In real life, celebrities are a much different animal. At least, they seem to be the exaggerated versions of us. Perhaps that's because we only ever hear about the extremes. But there is one aspect of celebrity life that doesn't need to be exaggerated to be ridiculous—their relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, regular people struggle with relationships too, but not at the same rate as celebs. It is incredibly rare for a Hollywood couple to stay together for any stretch of time, let alone forever. This may be because of the stress and travel related to show business. It may be because actors are usually beautiful people with millions of dollars and plenty of free time. That isn't the best recipe for monogamy. Obviously, there are the exceptions–the relationships that last–but this is very rare.</p><p>Now, many, if not most, Hollywood splits are done mutually. At least, they make it seem mutual. But that isn't always the case. There have been many high-profile divorces that were the result of one side simply hiring a lawyer to do their dirty work for them. Both sides have hidden behind lawyers, but today, we're looking at the men, the actors. Here are 20 Hollywood A-Listers Who Hired a Lawyer to Make Their Wives “Get The Point.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-hired-lawyer-lance-spiegel><strong>Brad Pitt Hired Lawyer, Lance Spiegel</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> is a master at breaking hearts. Now, that's not to say that he does it alone. He just has a way of ending things with a high-profile spouse and coming out looking like a hero. Look at the split between him and <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>. It was Jolie who, after a crazy flight into LA, filed for divorce. She cited "irreconcilable differences" and was looking to get custody of the couple's 33 children.</p><p><strong>Apparently, Brad flew off the handle during the flight and got fiery with the kids.</strong></p><p>But Brad didn’t take it laying down. He hired his own lawyer, Lance Spiegel, who got him cleared of any wrongdoing. The lawyer then made it public that Pitt was going for joint custody instead of sole custody because it was in the best interests of the children. The result is Pitt smelling like roses and Jolie seeming like a pesky little gremlin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-times-2-and-got-the-upper-hand><strong>Brad Pitt Times 2 (And Got The Upper-Hand)</strong></h2><p>The Pitt and Jolie divorce wasn’t the first time Mr. Pitt had a lawyer make him look like a boss. When he was married to <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>, they were the biggest couple on the planet. Now, despite reports that Pitt didn't leave Aniston for Jolie, the whole situation seems mighty fishy. Regardless,</p><p><strong>it may have been Jennifer who filed for divorce, but it was Pitt who got the upper hand in the end.</strong></p><p>Pitt's lawyer had him looking like the good guy and Aniston was thrashed in the tabloids. While his high-class lawyer may not be solely responsible, he sure helped when it was revealed.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-hired-a-lawyer-to-do-all-the-talking><strong>Tom Cruise Hired A Lawyer To Do All The Talking</strong></h2><p>It was about three days before <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> and <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> were about to celebrate their 10th anniversary when Cruise got his lawyer to break up with her for him. By filing for divorce,</p><p><strong>Tom was able to say all the things he couldn't muster up the courage to say to Nicole with his own mouth.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He even petitioned to get full custody of their two children, which he would be granted. Nicole Kidman may have been a giant star back then, but Tom came from the stars, and to the stars he would return with his children and his pride.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-times-2-was-this-the-plan-all-along><strong>Tom Cruise Times 2 (Was This The Plan All Along?)</strong></h2><p>Tom Cruise may be an alien in human skin, but he's a smart alien. When <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> filed for divorce and tried to get full custody of their child, Suri, Tom played it cool. He didn't "freak out!"</p><p><strong>He went and hired star lawyer Dennis Wasser to fight his battle for him.</strong></p><p>Now, on the surface, Tom's plans seem like they all failed. After all, Holmes got full physical custody of Suri. But Tom hadn't seen his child in 800 days or something like that before custody was granted. It's not like he couldn't fly to see her. He could have bought an airport if he needed to get a flight in a pinch. He could have had his Scientology bros transport him to her in a beam of alien light. But he didn't visit his daughter in any way. It's possible that this was part of his plan and his lawyer's loss just hammered home the point that Tom wanted to fly solo again, Maverick-style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jesse-williams---hired-a-lawyer-to-say-what-he-wanted-to-say><strong>Jesse Williams - Hired A Lawyer To Say What He Wanted To Say</strong></h2><p>Do we call Jesse Williams an A-lister? Probably not, but his split with Aryn Drake-Lee has been hilariously public, so we're including him. We do feel bad for the kids, but the mudslinging that's been taking place between these two makes us wonder who the children really are in this situation. After Williams first filed for divorce and tried to get full custody, Drake-Lee started accusing him of all sorts of nasty things. Williams has since hired a lawyer himself, trying to ensure that he doesn't have to pay spousal support. The lawyer helped him prepare this following statement,</p><p><strong>"My hard work has allowed Aryn the incredible privilege of being a stay-at-home mom, with a full-time nanny, able to be with our children when she wants. She is now punishing me for providing that privilege… This is how I always supported our family and Aryn has no problem enjoying the financial benefits, including the $50,695 per month I pay her in temporary spousal support."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Something he was likely not able to say himself...</p><h2 id=ewan-mcgregor---let-his-lawyer-take-the-heat><strong>Ewan McGregor - Let His Lawyer&nbsp;Take The Heat</strong></h2><p>For many years, <a href=#>Ewan McGregor</a> and his wife, Eve Mavrakis, were one of those lifetime couples. They were married for 22 years. That's certainly a lifetime in rich people years. Well, McGregor had seen enough. Or, maybe more accurately, McGregor had seen enough of Mavrakis and wanted to see more of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two Fargo stars reportedly fell for each other while shooting the show, and it led to McGregor having doubts about his marriage.</p><p><strong>While he could have talked to his wife about it and figured things out, he decided to let his lawyer do the talking.</strong></p><p>Not long after he was busted with Winstead, he "surprised" Mavrakis by filing for divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-pratt---separation-was-not-clear-enough><strong>Chris Pratt - Separation Was Not Clear Enough</strong></h2><p>Even though the details are still a little scattered and confusing, it seems that separation wasn't enough for <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a>. After he and wife of seven years, <a href=#>Anna Faris</a>, had announced that they were legally separating, Pratt took it one step further. Maybe it was because Faris didn't fully grasp that they were separated, or maybe separation wasn't enough for Pratt and he just didn't want to be officially married anymore. We don't know the whole truth.

But after Heard wrote a public letter about domestic abuse, the whole scale of who will get what in the divorce was changed. At first, it appeared that Heard was going to take Depp for everything he had. In the end,</p><p><strong>she did get quite a large fortune, but it was less than she had lined up in her sights.</strong></p><p>After the letter, Depp's lawyers insisted that Heard “violated the terms of their divorce.” This put a large dent in the settlement, but hopefully, the letter did some good for those suffering from abuse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laurence-fishburne---needed-a-lawyer-to-get-the-facts-straight><strong>Laurence Fishburne - Needed A Lawyer To Get The Facts Straight</strong></h2><p>Another one of those, hey, maybe this Hollywood couple will last, was <a href=#>Laurence Fishburne</a> and <a href=#>Gina Torres</a>.

Only a love story with a different ending than either one of us had expected." But that doesn't seem to be so true. It was Fishburne who filed for divorce. It was Fishburne who, through his lawyers, is asking for full custody of his daughter.
